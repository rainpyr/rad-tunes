# Getting Started with Rad Tunes React App

This [Rad Tune project](https://github.com/rainpyr/rad-tunes) was designed for Publicis Sapient Code Challenge [Publicis Sapient](https://www.publicissapient.com/).

A json file was provided as a back end API endpoint for HTTP API request. As no back end was designed, the file was saved in the public/db folder for access.

The webpage can be run as a search/filter site to get all artists of the same genre. Each genre can be selected from the dropdown list on the site, and relavant artists will be displayed in on the webpage.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Stacks Used

### `React JS`
React JS is used as the front end framework to display all elements.

### `Vanilla JS`

Vanilla JavaScript is the programming language.

## Bugs

* The tick in the dropdown list is shown at the awkward place.

* There is a white space/gap between the top of the webpage and the background.
